New Word Detection System
Overview
This project aims to develop a system capable of detecting newly coined words or phrases in a given language. The system utilizes natural language processing techniques to identify novel terms and track their usage over time.

Features
New Word Detection: Automatically identify and flag newly introduced terms or phrases.
Usage Tracking: Monitor the frequency and context of new words to understand their adoption and evolution.
Data Visualization: Visualize the emergence and usage trends of new words through interactive graphs and charts.
Customization: Configure the system to target specific languages, domains, or sources for new word detection.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/new-word-detection.git
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd new-word-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Collection: Provide input text data (e.g., news articles, social media posts) for analysis.

Preprocessing: Tokenize, clean, and preprocess the input data to prepare it for analysis.

New Word Detection: Apply the detection algorithm to identify potential new words or phrases.

Usage Tracking: Monitor the usage frequency and context of detected new words over time.

Visualization: Generate visualizations to illustrate the emergence and usage trends of new words.

Example
python
Copy code
from new_word_detection import NewWordDetector

# Initialize detector
detector = NewWordDetector()

# Analyze text data
text_data = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
new_words = detector.detect_new_words(text_data)

# Output detected new words
print("Detected New Words:", new_words)
